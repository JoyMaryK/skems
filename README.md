# SKEMS - Sports Kit and Equipment Management System 
SKEMS is a web application I designed and developed for staff members in the sports and games department at Egerton University to keep track of the various kit and equipment in the sports store.

## Features
- Registration and Login for both students and staff
- Booking of available sports equipment by students
- Reminder emails for upcoming deadlines to students with booked/unreturned items
- Real-time verification of issued/returned items by student to ensure non-repudiation
- Auto-Genetared list of students with unreturned items (list can be downloaded as PDF or printed)
- Dynamic chart that determines popular vs less popular sports 
- Dynamic chart that illustrates the state of the sports store - items available, booked, in good/bad condition
